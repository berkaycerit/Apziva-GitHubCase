# Apziva-GitHubCase
This project was created for Apziva internship application case.

I used elephantsql console to use postgresql in this project. 
I created cell in persons table for each user. These cells contain the user's name and abilities.

firstly run the code "pip install psycopg2" in the terminal to avoid getting an error. 
then you can run the server with "python manage.py runserver".
